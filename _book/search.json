It’s organized more like a journal than a textbook, and each topic is centered around a problem or error I’ve encountered while developing R packages, data visualizations, functions, and shiny applications.\nSome of the topics I’ve considered adding to this book have been already been covered (with more style and depth) in either the R inferno or What they forgot to teach you about R. If there’s any duplication of content, it’s presence should only indicate this topic was especially difficult for me to grasp, even after consulting these resources (multiple times).\nThis book was written in Quarto (learn more about Quarto books)."

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

> *This is a book created from markdown and executable code. See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.*

I've left the boilerplate text above because 1) everyone should know about Donald Knuth and his contributions to computational notebooks, and 2) I wanted to keep a working example for the `references.qmd` and `references.bib` files when I build the book.

## Publishing this book (meta)

I'm going to include the steps for publishing this book *inside* the book so I can come back later and know what I've done (readers might also find this information useful). 

This [quarto book project](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) has the following contents: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
fs::dir_tree(".", recurse = 0)
```

The GitHub repo for this book is [here](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/eRrata), and it's been set up to publish with GitHub pages.

## Using Git 

Basic knowledge of Git has become somewhat necessary when you decide to enter the R ecosystem (or other open-source projects). I won't be diving into Git commands here, but I *will* cover what commands I used to store and publish this book. 

1. Create a repository on GitHub.com like this one: [mjfrigaard/eRrata](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/eRrata) 

2. Add and commit the files in the book repo: 

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
git add -A
git commit -m "first commit"
```

4. Push the local repo to GitHub repo

```{verbatim}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false
git remote add origin git@github.com:mjfrigaard/eRrata.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

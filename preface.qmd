# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Who should read this book?

This book assumes the audience has no prior programming or computer experience, aside from using a keyboard and mouse to open files and folders. It's especially suitable for anyone lacking confidence in their computer literacy.

It's contents should serve as a quick start on unfamiliar topics, even for experienced data scientists, software engineers, etc., as long as the reader is not offended by overly simplified explanations of familiar material.

I've found having general knowledge of the topics in this book has made it easier to talk to experts and understand key issues, so I also hope it will be helpful for a wider audience.
